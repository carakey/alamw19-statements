                <p>This project is an encoding of statements issued by ALA, its divisions, sections,
                    and other affiliates in response to the incidents of racism and harassment that
                    occurred at ALA's 2019 Midwinter Meeting. The text has been encoded through a
                    combination of manual markup and iterative XSL transformations, and the
                    resulting data supports qualitative content analysis using XQuery.</p>

                    <p>[This Organization] voices our serious concern about the reported verbal
                        abuse of [Anonymous Person], at [Event].</p>

                    <p>[This Organization] reasserts our commitment to equity, diversity and
                        inclusion at all meetings and events. We have a zero-tolerance policy
                        towards harassment or intimidating and aggressive behavior. We strongly urge
                        [Organization] to hold their [Organization] accountable to ensure a safe
                        space for all who attend their conferences.</p>

                    <p>Incidents like these do not exist in a vacuum. We at [This Organization] are
                        committed to do better by our community of librarians, and we insist that as
                        our parent organization [Organization] take leadership to do the same.</p>

                <body>
                    <p>We at [This Organization] condemn strongly the incidents of racist behavior
                        that have been reported at the most recent [Event], the best known of which
                        is the verbal attack on [Named Person] at [Event]. Other attendees have
                        reported acts of aggression, exclusion, and racial profiling at this and
                        previous conferences. This ongoing pattern of exclusionary behavior is
                        absolutely unacceptable and completely contrary to our values as both a
                        profession and an organization.</p>

                    <p>We fully support the action steps outlined by [Named Person] (1) [Link]. We
                        note that in a statement issued on Thursday, January 31st, the
                        [Organization] Executive Board has made at least some steps towards each of
                        these requests. We urge [Organization] and the [Organization] Executive
                        Board to continue to move forward in addressing the concerns of its members.
                        Further, we request that, in the interest of transparency and
                        accountability, the [Organization] Conference Services Office give regular
                        accounts of incidents of racism, homophobia, and other bigotry reported at
                        conferences.</p>

                    <p>The change we must see goes beyond simple "diversity": we must take a truly
                        progressive approach to championing anti-racism in our actions. If we are to
                        live up to the directive in the [Organization] mission statement to "enhance
                        learning and ensure access to information for all," (2) [Link] we must do
                        better. We must protect each other, we must respect each other, and we must
                        value each other. If we will not do these things for each other, we cannot
                        do them for our communities.</p>

                    <p>The [This Organization] Board of Directors has learned of racist,
                        discriminatory, and harassing behavior at [Event] in [Place]. We would like
                        to express our support to those who were harassed and discriminated against
                        during this particular incident and to all those who have lived and worked
                        too long in unsafe environments.</p>

                    <p>We would also like to renew our commitment to our statement on Equity,
                        Diversity, and Inclusion and call upon [Organization] Executive Committee to
                        quickly respond, reassess, and renew its commitment to their fourth
                        strategic direction, through education and advocacy for our colleagues and
                        our patrons.</p>

                    <p>It is more important than ever that we as [This Organization] and as
                        librarians and library staff work on addressing the pervasive privilege and
                        bias within our profession and association. It is our responsibility to
                        continue this work so that we can continue to ensure “the right of access to
                        information for people of all identities, backgrounds, ages, and abilities
                        especially with regard to marginalized peoples.”</p>

                    <p>We should not – and do not – accept harassment, bullying or discrimination of
                        any kind in our profession or the work of [This Organization]. These
                        behaviors go against our values. Violations to our code of conduct will not
                        be tolerated.</p>

                    <p>We established a code of conduct because we take the responsibility of being
                        respectful to each other very seriously.</p>

                    <p>We send our sincere apologies to [Named Person] for what she went through at
                        [Event], which is unacceptable and doesn’t align with our core values.</p>

                    <p>[Implied Person] and [Implied Person] met with [Named Person] in [Place]
                        shortly before [Event] to share some nonpublic information about events
                        after the incident in question. [This Organization] leaders deeply regrets
                        any distress this caused; it was not the intent of [Implied Person] or [This
                        Organization] to threaten [Named Person] in any way.</p>

                    <p>[Anonymous Person] who instigated the incident has resigned and the Executive
                        Board has accepted his resignation.</p>

                    <p>We also offer our sincere apologies to members who also experienced
                        violations of the code of conduct at [Event].</p>

                    <p>We want to recognize that this incident has caused a lot of hurt and we are
                        working diligently to ensure that at all [This Organization] events
                        participants are - and feel - respected.  </p>

                    <p>The Executive Board will form a working group to look at [Event] and ways to
                        make it a safer space up to its continued viability.</p>

                    <p>We will review the current code of conduct complaint process to make it
                        stronger and more effective.</p>

                    <p>We will work on facilitated racial equity training for [Event] during
                        [Event]; that training and the code of conduct will be built into
                        [Organization] Orientation moving forward.</p>

                    <p>In collaboration with the Office for Diversity, Literacy and Outreach
                        Services, we will coordinate online and in-person resources on equity,
                        diversity and inclusion for all members and for [This Organization] staff
                        members.</p>

                    <p>[This Organization] and [Organization] have developed resources [Link] to
                        embed principles of equity, diversity and inclusion in the work library
                        workers do; see specifics for 2018 here [Link]. Last October during [Event],
                        the Executive Board voted to affirm that [This Organization] will apply a
                        social justice framework to the [Organization] Strategic Directions
                        [Link] for the next three-to-five years in the areas of Advocacy,
                        Information Policy, Professional and Leadership Development, and Equity,
                        Diversity and Inclusion. We are building on the 2019 [Program] about "White
                        Fragility" [Link].</p>

                    <p>This work can be messy, it takes time, but the Executive Board strives to
                        create a better association every day. We ask for your collaboration to help
                        us break through the systems of oppression and do the right thing at the
                        right time, each time, as it should be done.</p>

                <body>
                    <p>[This Organization] has learned that various conference attendees conveyed
                        experiencing inappropriate and unacceptable behavior, including displays of
                        racism and discrimination, at [Event] in [Place].</p>

                    <p>An ethnic affiliate of [Organization], [This Organization] is an association
                        committed to supporting the academic, professional, and personal efforts of
                        [Protected Group]. It is disheartening to learn that as we near our 50th
                        anniversary as an organization, we are still dealing with micro and macro
                        aggressions that make the library profession difficult for many people of
                        color to navigate.</p>

                    <p>In working with and for [Protected Group] we are cognizant of the systemic
                        racism that affects the lives of marginalized individuals and acknowledge
                        that, while people of color may reach leadership positions, we cannot
                        dismiss the hostility and inequity that comes with being a person of color
                        in a predominantly white profession, as well as the ways oppression impacts
                        all minority groups.</p>

                    <p>[This Organization] urges [Organization] to address racism and discrimination
                        in the profession, be it at the institutional level or at professional
                        development convenings. As a beacon for information that is viewed globally,
                        [Organization] must be the foundation for inclusion and respect for all. We
                        ask that [Organization] take action, and support librarians of color who
                        experience deliberate or unconscious discrimination, by taking all
                        accusations or concerns regarding racism seriously. It requires further
                        investigation and is a dialogue that must expand upon the program on 'White
                        Fragility'.</p>

                    <p>[This Organization] stands with individuals who have been seen as anything
                        other than their authentic selves recognizing that discrimination finds
                        roots in all marginalized communities and across intersections of identity.
                        We must not forget that while libraries are repositories and hubs for
                        information and resources, they are also the cornerstone of the human
                        condition where social justice plays a role in aiding in the quality of life
                        for all.</p>

                        embedded in the mission of libraries and archives, and in the work we do as

                        far from truly realizing the vision of racial equity that so many desire and
                        that must be a core principle if we are to be a just and equitable
                        society.</p>

                        educating leaders in libraries and archives about the systemic barriers to
                        achieving racial equity. [This Organization] recently adopted a code of
                        conduct [Link] for our meetings and interactions, and we commit to
                        bystander/ally training for the Board of Directors and staff to ensure that
                        our meetings are welcoming, inclusive, and free of harassment or
                        intimidation.</p>

                    <p>We will use this stark reminder of injustice as an opportunity for discussion
                        and growth, so that we might strengthen our role in advancing equity and
                        inclusion for all in our association and in our profession.</p>

                        statement [Link].</p>

                    <p>Like [Organization], [This Organization] is committed to creating an
                        inclusive environment for all our members. In its 2018–2022 Strategic Plan
                        [Link], the [This Organization] Board of Directors affirmed its commitment
                        to equity, diversity, inclusion and social justice (EDISJ). This work
                        requires persistent and vigilant efforts to speak out and take action
                        against oppression in [Functional Area], in society, and within the library
                        profession. To fully meet these goals, we must examine and test our systems
                        for acting when we fall short of our aspirations, acknowledge gaps and
                        shortcomings, and take action to do better. To this end, [This Organization]
                        commits to: Supporting and participating in training and forums to address
                        systemic racism in professional associations; Re-examining our own systems
                        for developing and delivering inclusive and respectful programs and events,
                        and for responding in a timely and transparent manner when incidents arise
                        that violate the [Organization] Code of Conduct; Continuing and expanding
                        training [Link] and resources that support equity, diversity, inclusion and
                        social justice in [This Organization], [Organization] and our libraries;
                        Equipping our members [Link] with tools, mentoring/coaching, learning
                        opportunities, and other resources to advocate and apply EDISJ principles in
                        their libraries and communities.</p>

                    <p>Please join [This Organization] leaders in reaffirming our commitment to
                        equity, diversity, inclusion and advancing social justice in our libraries,
                        our communities, and our association. We appreciate all your contributions
                        and look forward to our work together. </p>

                    <p>[This Organization] expresses its support and stands in solidarity with
                        [Organization] members who have experienced racism, discrimination, and
                        microaggressions within our association, most recently, but certainly not
                        only at [Event]. We are categorically opposed to the harassment and
                        aggression toward people of color in our profession and our professional
                        community, online and in person.</p>

                    <p>[This Organization] is also deeply concerned and disturbed to have been made
                        aware of past instances of homophobic and bullying remarks directed at
                        [Anonymous Person] during [Event]. We are equally categorically opposed to
                        the harassment, bullying, and discrimination of our members, and people of
                        all [Protected Group] and [Protected Group].</p>

                    <p>Recognizing and celebrating the wonderful diversity and intersectionality of
                        voices and rich, lived experiences within the library community, and of the
                        initial steps taken by [Organization] to address issues of equity,
                        diversity, and inclusion through the efforts of the Office of Diversity,
                        Literacy, and Outreach Services (ODLOS), [This Organization] acknowledges
                        there is much more work to be done, and will continue to help create safe
                        spaces for these voices to be heard and play an active role in our
                        organization. In conjunction with ODLOS, and in solidarity with
                        [Organization]’s five ethnic affiliates, [Organization], [Organization],
                        [Organization], [Organization], and [Organization], [This Organization] will
                        continue to work toward greater inclusion within our association and
                        professional community in whatever capacity it can.</p>

                    <p>[This Organization] also calls on [Organization] to be more proactive and
                        transparent in reporting instances of racism, bullying, and discrimination
                        and the action taken to address these instances, to review and reinforce its
                        code of conduct at all levels of the organization, and to provide
                        opportunities for all members to participate in this review.</p>

                        support those who experienced harassment or discrimination at [Event]. We
                        recognize that many in our profession have been marginalized, unrecognized,

                        heard and respected.</p>

                        set in the Equity Diversity and Inclusion Implementation Plan [Link]. [This

                        take quick action and provide leadership for the profession through
                        education and advocacy. </p>

                    <p> [This Organization], [Organization], and the library profession must
                        prioritize efforts to increase inclusion and respect for everyone. We are
                        committed to supporting and acting on changes needed to make our profession

                    <p>[This Organization] would like to echo and support the statement [Link] sent
                        earlier by [Organization] regarding the reported verbal abuse of [Anonymous
                        Person] as well as to express concern about additional racist incidents at
                        [Event] that were reported on social media.</p>

                    <p>[This Organization] affirms our commitment to equity, diversity, and
                        inclusion and would like to see [Organization] uphold their commitment to
                        creating inclusive spaces throughout their conferences, including in
                        programs, the exhibit hall, social events, and governance meetings. While
                        having a Statement of Appropriate Conduct [Link] is critical to ensuring
                        victims of harassment have recourse, what matters most is how victims and
                        the accused are treated in the investigative process. That one victim felt
                        that she was being silenced during the process is concerning. Greater
                        transparency should be provided to members of [Organization]’s elected
                        governance structures about how reports are handled while respecting the
                        privacy of those involved.</p>

                    <p>We appreciate the [Organization] Executive Board’s statement [Link] and hope
                        that it will ensure that structures are in place to address equity issues
                        and limit racial trauma within our organization. We appreciate that both
                        [Organization] and [Organization] are committed to providing anti-bias
                        training for leaders and hope that this is extended to staff as well.</p>

                    <p>While our profession is focused on serving our diverse communities, there is
                        a history in this country of libraries and librarians upholding racism. The
                        lack of diversity of our own profession reflects this. We can all do more to
                        confront racism in our libraries and professional organizations and [This
                        Organization] is committed to this work as well.</p>

                    <p>The [This Organization] Board of Directors is aware that [Event] attendees
                        have reported experiencing violations of the conference Code of Conduct,
                        including incidents of racism, harassment, and discrimination. We laud the
                        strength of those who have shared their experiences to draw needed attention
                        to violations, and we abhor the systemic inequities in our profession that
                        have normalized discriminatory, harassing, and racist behaviors.</p>

                    <p>As a division of [Organization], we are aware that [This Organization] also
                        has work to do to address systemic racism and oppressive practices within
                        [This Organization]. We recognize that [This Organization] is not as
                        representative as it needs to be. [This Organization] has a core commitment
                        to Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion [Link] and recognizes the urgency of
                        taking steps to create a responsive association that empowers all of its
                        members. As part of our commitment, we have arranged anti-bias training for
                        leaders and trainers within [This Organization] and funded additional
                        [Program] for colleagues of color to join and thrive in the profession. We
                        expect our leaders and members to be courageous in speaking against
                        harassment or bullying behavior when they witness it.</p>

                    <p>Our commitment to a more equitable, inclusive, and diverse association leads
                        us to strongly urge [Organization] to carry out the work it has promised to
                        do in its statement [Link] and to set up town hall sessions with
                        [Organization], the Executive Board, and the general membership, and to
                        seriously reflect on enacting our professional values. Our profession needs
                        to talk about the way that racism and systems that privilege whiteness have
                        permeated our profession and our professional events. The [This
                        Organization] Board, Conference planners, and staff will be reviewing plans
                        for [Event] [Link] in [Place] to ensure that it is a safe and welcoming
                        place for all.</p>

                    <p>This work is critical. We do it in service of building a more inclusive and
                        equitable association and profession, and more inclusive and equitable
                        libraries for our communities. We hope that all [This Organization] members
                        will reaffirm the Board’s commitment to being advocates for our colleagues
                        and advancing social justice in our communities and association.</p>

                        incidents are not singular or isolated, and, coupled with the recent racial
                        profiling and discrimination of Black future librarians at a university
                        library in [Place] [Link] and a public library in [Place] [Link],

                        toxic environments for people of color. [This Organization] acknowledges the
                        complexity of intersectional identities and how multiple systems of
                        oppression such as racism, sexism, classism, ableism and heterosexism (among
                        others) overlap and compound on the individual, and advocates for
                        prioritizing the experiences and voices of marginalized groups, and engaging
                        in difficult dialogues in order to create a more just, equitable, diverse,
                        and inclusive organization.</p>

                        engage with diversity in deeper ways. [This Organization] calls for
                        [Organization] to engage with the five ethnic-affiliates of [Organization],
                        [This Organization], [Organization], [Organization], and [Organization] to

                        draw attention to the systemic issues that our society and profession face.

                        productive. We are therefore in agreement with the numerous expressions of
                        concern and call for [Organization] to step up in leading our association
                        and its members through the difficult but necessary work of dismantling
                        system oppression within the profession, understanding differences, valuing
                        those differences, and ultimately, learning how to communicate and innovate
                        in an inclusive manner that welcomes diverse perspectives.</p>

                    <p>[This Organization] believes that education is a key component of this work.
                        For this reason, we have decided to commit funds to the creation and

                        other units of [Organization], we will develop trainings that we hope will
                        equip [This Organization] members with tools that empower active and
                        effective allyship, recognize and undo oppressive behaviors and systems, and
                        promote the practice of cultural humility, thereby collectively increasing
                        our collaborative capacity.</p>

                    <p>As always, [This Organization] stands committed to the values of diversity,
                        equity, and inclusion and welcomes opportunities to collaborate and partner
                        with [Organization] and beyond in order to realize these values fully. We
                        thank the [Organization] Executive Board and [Organization] for crafting an
                        appropriate statement about racism and discrimination in the Library
                        profession.</p>

                    <p>[This Organization] thanks [Organization], [Organization] Executive Board,
                        [Organization] and [Organization] for crafting such appropriate statements
                        against racism and discrimination in the Library profession, in response to
                        conference attendees receiving inappropriate and unacceptable behavior
                        during [Event]. We are in agreement with the expressions of concern and call
                        for [Organization] to step up in leading our association and its members
                        through the task of understanding, valuing differences and communicating
                        respectfully. Education with conversation is an essential component to a
                        journey of complete inclusion with fair and equal treatment for all. [This
                        Organization] stands committed to these values and welcomes the opportunity
                        to collaborate with the other affiliates and [Organization] to promote and
                        provide cultural sensitivity training.</p>

                    <p>Many of you know about the incident of racialized aggression [Link] that
                        [Named Person] experienced during the [Event] in [Place]. She was not alone;
                        others, too, shared experiences of aggression during [Organization] events,
                        this [Event] and earlier. These harmful experiences by people of color
                        continue to be endemic to our profession and our professional
                        associations.</p>

                    <p>In response, the [Organization] Executive Board [Link], the [Organization]
                        Board [Link], and [Organization] [Link] (a [Protected Group] affiliate of
                        [Organization]) have released statements condemning racism, harassment, and
                        discrimination within the profession. Additionally, two [Organization]
                        Councilors, [Named Person] and [Named Person] composed an open letter
                        addressing racialized aggression [Link] in [Place]; both [Organization]
                        Councilors and non-councilors are invited to sign.</p>

                    <p>We, the [This Organization] Executive Committee, are committed to cultivating
                        an anti-racist ethos across [This Organization]. We do not speak on behalf
                        of [Organization] or [Organization]. Rather, we are communicating the steps
                        we will take as leaders within [This Organization] to enact our shared
                        professional values.</p>

                    <p>We will commit our time slot for [Program] at [Event] to showcasing social
                        justice work in [Functional Area]. We will hold a virtual town hall to
                        acknowledge the continuing impact of racism on librarians and librarianship
                        and organize collective action we can take to create anti-racist communities
                        within the section and across [Organization]. Finally, we will arrange for
                        training on anti-oppressive meeting facilitation to incoming [This
                        Organization] committee chairs, committee members, and discussion group
                        conveners.</p>

                    <p>We also want to hear from you. How can [This Organization] take action to
                        become the kind of inclusive professional community each of us deserves? To
                        share your thoughts with all members of the [This Organization]’s Executive
                        Committee, please write to [This Organization] [Link]. You may also reach
                        out to any of us individually.</p>

                    <p>[This Organization] was formed so that library workers engaged in [Functional
                        Area] could see a place for themselves within [Organization] and
                        [Organization]. Together we must make sure that the [This Organization] is a
                        safe and welcoming community for all of our members. Let’s get to work.</p>

                    <p>In light of reports of incidents of harassing, discriminatory and racist
                        behavior that occurred at [Event], the [This Organization] Board offers its
                        support to the individuals who were the targets of such behavior and affirms
                        the statement from the [Organization] Executive Board [Link] in its
                        denunciation of such behavior, as well as its call to uphold
                        [Organization]’s Statement of Appropriate Conduct [Link].</p>

                    <p>In particular, [This Organization] supports the goals in the Executive Board
                        Statement to provide resources and training on equity, diversity and
                        inclusion for all members and to apply a social justice framework to the
                        [Organization] Strategic Directions. We hope to work with [Organization] to
                        strengthen and improve the Statement of Appropriate Conduct and ensure its
                        enforcement. [This Organization] also recognizes that words are not enough
                        for this situation and must be transformed into action.</p>

                    <p>[This Organization] will review its own activities, both online and
                        in-person, to determine what changes should be made to bring our actions in
                        line with our rhetoric. [This Organization] is engaged in supporting equity,
                        diversity and inclusion initiatives through work such as developing a code
                        of ethics for [Functional Area], supporting the [Functional Area] needs of
                        cultural heritage institutions through [Program], providing grants for
                        library professionals from developing countries to attend [This
                        Organization] online courses, supporting [Organization] Spectrum Scholars,
                        and providing people from underrepresented groups with awards to attend
                        [Event]. Our current activities, however, are just a starting point. Our new
                        strategic plan, currently in draft form, includes explicit support for
                        equity, diversity and inclusion as a core objective, promulgating the
                        importance of EDI to all levels and activities within [This Organization].
                        [This Organization] will invest financial resources to put the commitments
                        of the [This Organization] strategic plan and this statement into action. We
                        believe in the adage that every budget is a moral document—it is both
                        practically and symbolically important that we put money behind our work in
                        this area.</p>

                    <p>Education and empowerment are key components of the work going forward. We
                        will highlight the Statement of Appropriate Conduct at all [This
                        Organization] meetings, we will ensure that participants are able to contact
                        designated [This Organization] EDI resource representatives in case of
                        conduct violations, and we will provide training to [This Organization]
                        leaders to help them become skilled meeting facilitators who can intercede
                        when behavior becomes problematic. In addition to strengthening [This
                        Organization]’s support for EDI, we will pursue collaborations and
                        partnerships with other [Organization] divisions and offices in support of
                        these goals, including working with [Organization] and [Organization] to
                        develop bystander/allyship webinars and other training.</p>

                    <p>[This Organization] remains committed to improving equity, diversity and
                        inclusion within the profession and within [This Organization] and to
                        eliminating incidents of harassment, racism and discrimination. This
                        statement serves to reaffirm and redouble our efforts in this area.</p>
